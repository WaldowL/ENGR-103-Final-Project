The game plays a series of notes of a song. When the next note in the sequence is higher, if the player presses the right button, they receive a point. When the 
next note in the series is a lower freqency, if the player presses the left button, they revieve a point. If the note is the same pitch, if the player presses both buttons, they recieve a point.
At the end, the total number of points divided by the total number of notes gives the final score.
